## Wireframes
To lay the groundwork for the project, I utilized Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes. These wireframes were essential in visualizing the layout, structure, and user flow of the application before diving into the actual development.

### Figma for Wireframing
- Tool Used: Figma
- Type of Wireframes: Low-Fidelity

The primary purpose of the low-fidelity wireframes was to:

Define Layouts: Establish the basic structure of each page, including the arrangement of elements such as headers, navigation bars, content sections, and footers.
Outline User Flow: Visualize the user journey through the application, ensuring that navigation and interactions are intuitive and logical.
Identify Key Features: Highlight the core functionalities and components of the application, such as the task management interface, search functionality, and user authentication processes.
Process
Sketch Initial Concepts:

Started by sketching initial ideas on paper to outline the fundamental layout and features.
Create Wireframes in Figma:

Transitioned to Figma to create digital versions of these sketches.
Designed wireframes for key pages including the task list, task form and login, and the footer with social links.

Benefits
Using low-fidelity wireframes in Figma provided several benefits:

Early Visualization: Enabled early visualization of the application’s layout and functionality, facilitating better planning and design.
Clear path of what to build.

Conclusion
The low-fidelity wireframes created in Figma played a crucial role in shaping the project’s design and ensuring a user-centered approach. They served as a tool for guiding the development process and contributed to a well-organized and intuitive application.
